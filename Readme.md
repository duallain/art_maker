# Things to figure out/TODO

* get imports working correctly, it's nice to test single classes in that class, but something I'm doing breaks that
* how to autoregister the scenarios
* scenarios with multiple turtles
* scenarios with processing instead of turtles?
* there are a few args I'm setting defaults for in base class that maybe shouldn't be in base class
    * (maybe base class init doesn't take them? figure out how to do some simple assignment, or require some attributes?)
